Summarization of a 10page Software design and design pattern by ArjanCodes as requested from OsMaxin

Before I proceed to the summarization of what a software design is, I'll want us to talk about what a software design is before pointing out some key point that make up the design pattern...

Software design is basically the process of planning and defining the architecture and component of a software system. It's more like the blueprint of a how a software system will be built.

Considering this definition, which involves the process of planning, we would say what is the software application (or new feature) for, who is it intended for, what problem does it solve and you'll find out that there's a need to spend more time in the conceptual stage and less time implementing it even though we can't dictate the actual time a software project (or a new feature) would take as a beginner but hopefully looking out for a quicker and efficient development

In a case where we're adding a new feature to an already existing software, it's important to observe what impact the feature has on the overall structure of the interface(e. g, if there are big changes in the organization of menus, navigation, dashboard, etc)

Then technically, it's important for a developer to put into consideration the details of some external ideas that will make a new feature come to life like wondering if there are new tables to add to a database, if there are algorithms or libraries that are important, what third-party software is needed to build the software or features, etc.

When we come to testing in software design, we'll say it helps us find bugs, produce better and more reliable code. We'll say it give the developer a tester's mindset, which is a mindset that every piece of code potentially breaks something which automatically gives the developer a consciousness to always organize their code as effective and efficient as possible. 

In the development aspect, we'll have to consider if there are any architectural or devOps changes needed like adding microservice, changes in development pipeline, etc that might lead to issues with configuration, connection with other services during testing or while being pushed to the cloud

Then lastly, we'll talk about planning in general. we'll start by asking how much time will developing the software or feature cost, what are the development milestones and complications , what are the main risk factors and what alternative route are there to take if this risk aren't easily met... But as a beginning developer, it's hard to estimate how much time developing a piece of software takes and you'll get better at it after doing some couple of big/advanced projects, and the earlier u figure out main risk factors, the earlier you'll bring solutions to them, and the more risk factors you have in the software design, the more time you need to reserve for nasty surprises
